Contributing
============

We gracefully accept bug reports and contributions from the community.
However there are some requirements and mechanisms that we expect
contributors to follow.

Coding Standards
----------------
- The code should follow the ARFNET conding style, but improving on it is
  possible.
- The code should be written in a clean and readable style.
- The code must be portable, generic and compatible with updated systems.
- The code should be as secure, reviewed and tested as much as possible from a
  security point of view.

Breaking Changes
----------------
Breaking changes need to be justified, and will be discussed on the
mailing list.
In case of a breaking changes, post a patch draft with --rfc

Making a Contribution
---------------------
1. Use git to register your development process.
2. git-rebase large amounts of small commits.
3. Use git format-patch to generate a patchset, be sure to have your
   git config updated and correct.
4. Email it to the development@xxxxxxxxx mailing list,
   indicating "PATCH arfnet2-lists" with --subject-prefix,
   using git send-email. Include a patch comment with --compose.

Then the appropiate maintainer will review the code for problems, and if checks
OK, the maintainer will apply the patch on the development branch.
Otherwise, the maintainer might request changes or reject the patch.
Status of your contribution and followups will be posted in the mailing list.
